# tireproject
A very amateur and not completed project that I did on my own about car tires and QR Codes.

Tires have their own special number, type, etc., and I have developed an idea for people to reach these features more easily. 

After logging into the application, it will add the tire profile to the profile by entering the tire information, and after entering the tire information, a QR code will be generated within the application that contains the tire information and user will be able to print out this qr code and put it in his car so that user can access this information more easily.

In my project, I decided to use C# for data extraction, SQL for database and html, javascript, css for interface.
