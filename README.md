# Tire Project


A very amateur and not completed project that I did in my 2nd grade about car tires and QR Codes.

Tires have their own special number, type, etc., and I have developed an idea for people to reach these features more easily. 

After logging into the application, it will add the tire profile to the profile by entering the tire information, and after entering the tire information, a QR code will be generated within the application that contains the tire information and user will be able to print out this qr code and put it in his car so that user can access this information more easily.


## Key Features : 

-Login Page
-Adding tire profile to the logged in user
-QR Code generation for the submitted tire informations
-Database Connection



## Technologies Used : 
-Frontend : HTML/CSS/Javascript
-Backend : .NET(C#)
-Database : MySQL
